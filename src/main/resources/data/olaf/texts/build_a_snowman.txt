Do you want to build a snowman?
Come on, let's go and play!
I never see you anymore
Come out the door
It's like you've gone away
We used to be best buddies, and now we're not
I wish you would tell me why!
Do you want to build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman
Go away!
Okay, bye
Do you want to build a snowman? Or ride our bike around the halls?
I think some company is overdue
I've started talking to the pictures on the walls!
It gets a little lonely
All these empty rooms
Just watching the hours tick by
(tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock)
Please I know you're in there
People are asking where you've been
They say, "have courage" and I'm trying to
I'm right out here for you
Just let me in
We only have each other
It's just you and me
What are we gonna do?
Do you want to build a snowman?
